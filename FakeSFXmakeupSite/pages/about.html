            <p>
                WE ARE TOM AND JENNY SMITH AND OUR WONERFUL COLLEAGUE JHON BACK, WORKED ON 50 FEATURE FILMS AND OUR

                enthusiastically dedicated to participating in exciting projects of all sizes.
                Wy own style is fresh, clean and inventive. I have an invaluable eye for details and I am very hard
                working. This has led to me being employed for numerous productions including fashion shows, film, music
                videos and television.
                we have almost 50 credits on IMDB for my makeup and SFX in the film industry.
                wa head makeup designer for Imagine Dragons’ ‘Thunder’ music video in Dubai, Elton John’s ‘Bennie and
                The Jets’, and the Oscar-nominated film, ‘Black Sheep’, and many other Netflix movies. I also worked on
                the promotional campaigns for HBO's True Blood, Terminator, and TV drama, Black Sails, in the UK.
                we have had the privilege of working in the West End as the makeup artist at Leicester Square Theatre.
                our passion is travel and being a makeup artist allowed me to work around the world on feature film
                projects in Jordan, Iraq, Mexico and for the royal family in Abu Dhabi.
                our work has been published in magazines and advertising campaigns and I have worked with many
                celebrities including Big Narstie, Miriam Margolyes, Kate Nash, Zyan Malik, Skunk Anansie, Caroline
                Wozniacki and the author of Fifty Shades of Grey, E.L. James.
                we have also worked for brands such as Barclays, Pepsi Max, Ryanair, Samsung and Captain Morgan.
                we previously opened and ran a school for beauty makeup, Art Working Centre, and gave private workshops
                and a bilingual sfx makeup course at Esher College.
